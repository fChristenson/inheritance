# Inheritance

## What we will cover

* What is inheritance?
* When do we want to use it?

## Notes

One of the most basic concepts in OOP (object oriented programming) is the concept we call inheritance.

Inheritance means that you have a class of something and now we can **extend** from that class to create
a new one that will share all the methods and properties of the parent or **super class**.

The reason we want this is so that we can create classes that hold things that are common and move that
which is specific to different **subclasses**.
